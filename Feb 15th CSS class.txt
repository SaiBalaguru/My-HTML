			JAVASCRIPT
1) It's a scripting language. It's predecessor is Flash.
2) It's used in front end. In back end, we will be using is Node JS to make Servers. 
3) it's a heavily typed language. 

1) Check the sources tab, to find whether which files are loaded into the browser.
2) it's always recommended that Javascript file must be end of the body tag.

variable declarations - var 
arrays, functions,int, string - datatypes in JS.
1) there is keyword called typeof - to know the type of var.
2) browser is itself an object named as "window".
3) Any variable declared inside a function, it's life time is only inside that function paranthesis.
4) two js file linked to a single html file, is global all over the browser.
Purpose of JavaScript
1) Accessing the server and uploading in the server. 
2) Modifying the user interface.
3) html = document object
4) browser = window object

window.document will print the entire html code.
This is called as document object module.
1) document.getElementID(); - it gives only one element.
2) document.getElementsByClassName(); - It gives all elements by class name. 
3) document.getElementsByTagName(); -   It gives all elements by tag name.

******* Important Note ******
1) The script must be declared just above </body>
2) All validations must be written initially and can be called whenever required.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adapting the best practices to Write JS:
1) It is always recommended to start the 1st line of the file with - use "Strict". 
Without use strict all the variable is considered Global, which will be later to debug; 
It conveys the developer to declare the variable. 
Ex:
'use strict'
abcd = 10; // An exception will occur that the variable is not defined.

Note: JS is an object based and not object oriented, since there are no classes in JS.
